#Rev-Quiz Buzz 

#Project 3 for 210628 Vimal Batch


#Project Description

Revature Quiz Buzz is a full-stack application. Users of the application will be able to take quizzes made by other users, as well as create quizzes themselves. While creating a question, a user will create one, or many, questions and mark which answer is correct. The creator will also assign the number of points a question is worth and the total number of points available will be tracked. Alternatively, after a user submits a quiz that they select, they can compare their answers with the correct answers for the quiz to allow for a quick feedback.
